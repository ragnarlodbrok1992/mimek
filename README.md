# MIMEK engine

## TODOS

I'm right now only concerned with C++ implementation.
I'm building simple UI elements to work with.
For now I have layout that holds buttons.

### TASKS

1. Create label for buttons.
2. Add more button to layout.
3. Create a debug messages to display in engine.

### TIPS

Check vcvars.bat file and setup for your used compiler.
This engine has implementations in C++(using SDL), C# and Jai.
Because it is a learning project.
